# Cohort-Analysis
# Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform Cohort Analysis using Python to gain insights into user behavior and characteristics over time. Cohort analysis is a valuable technique for businesses to understand user engagement patterns in a granular and actionable way.

# Objectives
- Analyze user behavior patterns across different time periods
- Compare new vs. returning user trends
- Examine user engagement duration over time
- Create visualizations to identify actionable insights
- Build cohort matrices for comprehensive analysis

# Prerequisites
bash pip install pandas
pip install plotly
pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib

# Analysis Process
1. Data Preprocessing

Data loading and exploration
Missing value analysis
Data type conversion (Date column to datetime)
Descriptive statistics calculation

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Trend Analysis: New vs. Returning users over time
Duration Analysis: User engagement patterns (Day 1 vs Day 7)
Correlation Analysis: Relationships between variables

3. Cohort Analysis

Weekly Grouping: Data grouped by week of the year
Metric Calculation: Weekly averages for all key metrics
Cohort Matrix: Heatmap visualization of weekly performance

# Key Visualizations

1. User Trend Analysis

Line charts showing new and returning user patterns
Interactive Plotly visualizations


2. Duration Trend Analysis

Comparative analysis of Day 1 vs Day 7 engagement
Time series visualization


3. Correlation Matrix

Heatmap showing relationships between variables
Seaborn-based correlation visualization


4. Cohort Matrix

Weekly performance heatmap
Color-coded insights for easy interpretation


# Key Findings

1. Strong Correlation: Positive relationship between new and returning users
2. Weekly Variations: Significant fluctuations in user acquisition across weeks
3. Peak Performance: Week 47 showed highest user engagement
4. Duration Patterns: User engagement duration varies independently of user acquisition
